# Project AI Guide (Home Profile)

This project uses Syam's global AI preferences plus any project-specific notes here.

## How to behave

- Read `AI-coding-style.md` at the root and follow it.
- If `memory-bank/` exists, use it as AI-facing project documentation.
- Respect `.clinerules` for Cline-specific behavior, if present.

## Project specifics

(Add any project-local notes here.)
